### The aim of this course is to develop a piece of (reasonably) complex software based on a given description. 

#### • The goal of this software development project is to produce an online ‘tactical’ card game which combines card game mechanics with a chess like board.
#### • You will be developing the core back end service that manages and progresses the game as the player takes actions in a Web browser.
#### • A pre built project template that implements the browser side of the game will be provided to you
#### • The final product should enable a human player to complete a game with a semi intelligent AI opponent .


###  • The main pieces of code you will be developing are:
#### • Game Loop Logic: The core game loop that enables players to interact with the board according to the game rules
#### • Game State Tracking: A store that maintains the state of the board, players and their deck/hand during the game
#### • Cards : You will need to implement 20 unique cards that can be played during the game
#### • AI : A basic automated opponent for the human to play against that supports decision making and core actions

#### The pre-provided code hasn't been pushed to the repository due to university guidelines. The repository only contains the code which is coded by me and my team member.
